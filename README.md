InjectorJS
==========

InjectorJS (temporary name) is a new way to develop js-based applications. The idea behind InjectorJS is a dependency injection framework where the container is shared by everyone, making every application developed and every component a collaborative effort.

Consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/netanelgilad/InjectorJS/wiki) to get an idea about what this project is all about.

The idea is in very early stages. If this page has intrguied you in any way, contact me at netanelgilad@gmail.com and share your thoughts.
